<h1>How To Valorant</h1>
  <h3>This page will explain the sign up/ installation proccess for Valorant. As well as, include how to play the poplar FPS game.</h3>

<h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
  <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. </p>

<h2>How to Sign Up and Download Valorant</h2>
  <p>The first step of signing up and downloading Valorant is to access the <a href="https://playvalorant.com" target="_blank">Valorant Home Page</a></p>
  <p>Then, you must click the red PLAY FREE button in the middle of the screen.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="playfree.png" width="560" height="280"></div>
  <p>One you have clicked the PLAY FREE button, the website asks if you would like to sign in to a pre-existing account, or to sign-up. Click the WHITE MAKE ACCOUNT button. </p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="makeone.png" width="560" height="280"></div>
  <p>In order to make any RIOT account (including leage of legends and other RIOT games) you must insert your email. Once you have put in your email,</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="email.png" width="560" height="280"></div>
  <p>After you enter a valid email address, you must enter your birthday.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="birthday.png" width="560" height="280"></div>
  <p>Next, you must fill in a username. This username will be used to sign into the RIOT client and for signing in on the website.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="username.png" width="560" height="280"></div>
  <p>The last step in the sign-up process is to enter a unique password.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="password.png" width="560" height="280"></div>

<h2>Downloading Valorant</h2>
  <p>This next step is the most simple, once you have made a RIOT account, all you have to do is click download. The downloading process time may vary based on your device, but the avergae install time is 10-20 minutes.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="download.jpg" width="560" height="300"></div>
  <p>Once Valorant has been properly installed on your PC, all you have to do is put your username and password that you made earlier. (see earlier image if confused)</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="signin.webp" width="560" height="300"></div>
  <p>After you sign into your RIOT account, you may enter a RIOT ID. Your RIOT ID is what other Valorant players see when you are playing with/ against them. You may change this ID every 30 days, as well as the set of numbers after the #. The numbes behind the # can be changed into any 3-5 letter word after 30 days of owning the account. Any player can have the same name, but a different #.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="riotid.jpg" alt="enter display name screen" width="560" height="300"></div>
  <p>Once you have thought long and hard about the PERFECT gamertag for your Valorant account, you can play the game. But, how does the game work?</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="play.webp" width="560" height="300"></div>
<h2>How to Play Valorant?</h2>
  <p>Once you have properly made a RIOT account and downloaded the game, you can finally start playing.</p>
  <p>This 5v5 firt-person-shooter game offers a very similar play style to the other popular FPS game CSGO.</p>
  <p>Before you enter your first round, you get to pick from a group of Agents, each with their own role and special skills designed to work alongside each other toward a win (see agents list later on the page).</p>
  <p>After everyone selects their Agent (even if you picked a bad one), you’ll jump into a random map (see list of maps later on the page) and formally enter the first round.</p>
  <p>Start a round as either attacker or defender and switch sides in between. Before you do either, you’ll need to navigate the buy phase, which lets you purchase weapons and abilities. What you buy shapes how you can win.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="guns.png" width="460" height="240"></div>
  <p>Now that you have seen all of the gun options, its time to decide what to buy on the first round. Depending on your agent, you will want to buy what fits your play style and amount of money.</p>
  <p>At the start of the first round you start with 800 credits (in game money) this only allows you to buy pistols. Depending on the amount of roudns you win, the amount of kills you get and how much you spent the past rounds, will decide your money for that round.</p>
  <p>Understanding what to buy, such as abilities or guns, can determine how successful you are at Valorant.</p>
  <p>To win the round as attackers, you must either kill the entire oppsoing team, or plant the spike(a bomb) and wait for it to detonate. Some maps may be attacker or defender sided.</p>
  <p>To win on defense, you must either kill the entire opposing team, wait for the time in the round to run out (meaning the attackers ran out of time to plant the spike), or defuse the spike once it is planted.</p>
  <p>Technically, there is no right or wrong way to win or lose a round, but you will get made fun of for winning or losing a round in specific ways :)</p>

<h2>List of Valorant Agents</h2>
  <p>Here is a picture with all of the valorant agents, their role in the game, and where the agent is from.</p>
  <div class="img1"><img src="agents.png"></div>

<h2>Agent Roles</h2>
  <h4>Duelist</h3>
    <p>Duelists. Duelists are “self-sufficient fraggers,” according to Riot's official description. They're the agents that create some of the most impact, offering aggression to a team comp. A Duelist should be expected to seek out engagements and frag, may that be finding the opening pick or clutching out a round.</p>
  <h4>Initiator</h3>
    <p>The abilities of agents under the Initiator role focus on flushing enemies out of hiding spots and corners in order to assist the team when charging into battle.</p>
  <h4>Sentinel</h3>
    <p>These agents are “defensive experts who can lock down areas and watch flanks, both on attack and defender rounds.” Since the game involves planting or defusing the Spike, Sentinels are very important.</p>
  <h4>Controller</h3>
    <p>The abilities of agents under the Controller role allow them to assist their teammates by cutting enemy vision, taking control of an area, and forcing enemies into choke points.</p>

<h2>Valorant Maps</h2>
<p>There are curently 7 maps on the map rotation at the moment. The 8th map, known as Split, was the first Valorant map ever created, and has since been removed from the competitive queue due to the addition of the new map Pearl.</p>

<h2>This concludes the How to Valorant guide.</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading my How to Valorant guide, I hope this gave you a better grasp at how the game is played, and how to sign-up and download the game properly!</p>
